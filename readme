I've successfully implemented end-to-end login automation for the Sauce Demo website using Cucumber, Selenium WebDriver, and Java. This project ensures robust testing of login scenarios, covering both successful and unsuccessful login attempts.

🌐 Key Features:

Scenarios: Tested various login scenarios, including valid and invalid credentials.

Page Objects: Implemented a modular Page Object Model for cleaner and maintainable code.

Assertions: Utilized TestNG assertions to validate expected outcomes.

WebDriver Management: Configured browser options dynamically using a properties file.

📊 Detailed Reporting:
Implemented comprehensive reporting for test execution results. The report provides insights into test coverage, pass/fail status, and detailed logs, ensuring transparency and facilitating quick issue identification.
